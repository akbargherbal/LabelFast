## Session 1 Context: LabelFast Project (LGID-HR Frontend Hardening)

**Date:** (Today's Date - e.g., 2025-05-11)

**Input:**

- `v003.html`: Single-file HTML, CSS, JS proof-of-concept for "LabelFast" text annotation tool.
- `README.md`: Document describing LabelFast v003, its philosophy, features, and PoC status.
- `LGID_FE.md`: Paper detailing the **LGID-HR (LLM-Guided Hardening & Refinement)** methodology for test-verifying LLM-generated frontend PoCs.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Methodology Review:** Reviewed and confirmed understanding of the LGID-HR framework.
2.  **Candidate PoC Selection (Pre-Phase 0-HR):**
    - Selected `v003.html` as the candidate PoC for hardening based on its functional richness and alignment with project goals.
3.  **Phase 0-HR: PoC Analysis, Test Planning & Environment Setup:**
    - **`PoC_Interaction_Spec.md` Creation:** Collaboratively drafted and finalized the `PoC_Interaction_Spec.md` document, detailing key UI components, JavaScript functions/modules, and observed user interactions within `v003.html`.
    - **JavaScript Testing Framework Setup:**
      - Recommended Jest with Testing Library.
      - Created `package.json` and installed necessary dev dependencies (`jest`, `@testing-library/dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `jest-environment-jsdom`).
      - Created `jest.config.js` with `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'`.
      - Created `__tests__` directory.
    - **Refactoring for Testability:**
      - Extracted JavaScript from `v003.html` into a separate `app.js` file, linked via `<script src="./app.js" defer></script>`.
      - Added `data-testid` attributes to key HTML elements in `v003.html` for more reliable test querying.
    - **`PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` Creation:** Collaboratively drafted and finalized the `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`, outlining modules/interactions for hardening and key test scenarios for each.
4.  **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading) - In Progress:**
    - **Step 1.A (Generate Tests):** Generated `__tests__/initial_load.test.js` with initial test cases for Module 1.
    - **Test Environment Debugging:**
      - Resolved "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" by changing `import` to `require` in the test file.
      - Addressed `TypeError: selectedSpan.scrollIntoView is not a function` by mocking `HTMLElement.prototype.scrollIntoView` in the test file.
      - Addressed "SyntaxError: Identifier 'X' has already been declared" by:
        - Refactoring `app.js` to wrap its content in an `initializeApp()` function.
        - Exposing necessary variables and functions from `initializeApp` to the `window` object for test access.
        - Updating `initial_load.test.js` to call `window.initializeApp()` in `beforeEach` and to clean up globals in `afterEach`.
        - Ensuring `app.js` calls `initializeApp()` on `DOMContentLoaded` or when script is loaded deferentially for browser execution.
      - Resolved `TypeError: expect(...).toHaveTextContent is not a function` (and similar for other matchers) by:
        - Installing `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
        - Creating `jest.setup.js` to `require('@testing-library/jest-dom')`.
        - Updating `jest.config.js` to use `setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js']`.
    - **Step 1.B & 1.C (Execute & Refine/Fix):** Iteratively ran tests, identified a failing assertion in the "Completed!" message test related to the help button's visibility, and corrected the test assertion to match the code's behavior (checking for `.hidden` class instead of DOM removal).
    - **Module 1 Completion:** All 7 tests for Module 1 in `initial_load.test.js` are now passing.

**Current LGID-HR Stage:**

- **Phase 0-HR: COMPLETE.**
- **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.**
  - `app.js` has been significantly refactored for testability.
  - Test environment is stable.
  - Relevant documentation (`PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) updated.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 2):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    - Ensure all changes from Session 1 (updated `v003.html`, `app.js`, `initial_load.test.js`, Jest config files, `package.json`, documentation) are committed.
2.  **Begin Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 2's scope and test objectives.
    - **Step 2.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate (with LLM assistance if desired) a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`) for the `normalizeWords()` and `renderCorrectionArea()` functions.
    - **Step 2.B (Execute Tests):** Run the new tests against the current `app.js`.
    - **Step 2.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** If tests fail, analyze failures and refine/fix `app.js` until all Module 2 tests pass.
    - **Step 2.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** Briefly check rendering in browser; re-run Module 1 tests.
    - **Step 2.E (Documentation & Commit):** Update `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` and commit changes.
3.  Continue iteratively through the modules defined in `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`.

**Session 2 Activities & Outcomes (Current Session):**

1.  **Reviewed Plan:** Confirmed focus on Module 2 from `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`.
2.  **Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area):**
    - **Step 2.A (Generate Tests):**
      - Created `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`.
      - Drafted comprehensive tests for `normalizeWords()` function (10 tests).
      - Drafted tests for `renderCorrectionArea()` function, covering:
        - Availability on `window`.
        - Display of "Sentence is empty..." message (1 test).
        - Correct creation of `<span>` elements for words (1 test).
        - Correct `textContent` and `data-index` for word spans (1 test).
        - Correct application of selection classes (1 test).
        - Verification that word span click listeners update selection correctly (using direct DOM `.click()`) (1 test).
        - Verification that word span dblclick listeners trigger `initiateWordEdit` effects (using direct DOM `dispatchEvent`) (1 test).
    - **Step 2.B (Execute Tests) & 2.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):**
      - All 10 tests for `normalizeWords()` passed without changes to `app.js`.
      - Iteratively developed and ran tests for `renderCorrectionArea()`.
      - Identified and fixed a bug in `renderCorrectionArea` where `window.selectedWordIndex` was not set to `-1` when displaying the "empty sentence" message. This fix was applied to `app.js`.
      - Debugged and resolved challenges in testing event listeners due to DOM manipulation within event handlers, opting for direct DOM event dispatch (`.click()`, `dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent(...))`) for reliable verification of listener attachment and core effects.
      - All 7 tests for `renderCorrectionArea()` are now passing.
    - **Module 2 Completion:** All 17 tests for Module 2 in `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js` are now passing.

**Current LGID-HR Stage:**

- **Phase 0-HR: COMPLETE.**
- **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.**
- **Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.**
  - `app.js` updated with a fix for `renderCorrectionArea`'s empty state.
  - `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js` created and all tests passing.
  - Relevant documentation (`PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) should be updated to reflect Module 2 completion.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 3):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    - Ensure all changes from Session 2 (updated `app.js`, new `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`, updated documentation like `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) are committed.
2.  **Begin Phase 3-HR (Module 3: Word Selection & Navigation):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 3's scope:
      - **Target JS:** `selectWord()`, `moveSelection()`, click/dblclick listeners on word spans (from `renderCorrectionArea` - *note: basic listener attachment was covered in Module 2, Module 3 will focus more on the *behavior* of `selectWord` and `moveSelection` themselves, and effects of keyboard navigation via `globalKeyHandler`*), relevant parts of `globalKeyHandler()` (`ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `Space`, `Shift+Space`).
      - **Key Test Scenarios/Objectives:**
        - `selectWord()`:
          - Correctly updates `window.selectedWordIndex` for valid, out-of-bounds, and edge-case indices.
          - Calls `renderCorrectionArea()` (verified by checking UI updates/class changes).
          - Correctly handles `isEditingWord` guard.
          - (Optional: `scrollIntoView` mock call verification if deemed critical, though it's often a side effect of less importance for core logic).
        - `moveSelection()`:
          - Correctly calculates and calls `selectWord()` for next/previous, including wrapping.
          - No action if only one word or no words.
          - Correctly handles `isEditingWord` guard.
        - `globalKeyHandler` for selection:
          - `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` keys call `moveSelection(-1)` / `moveSelection(1)`.
          - `Space`/`Shift+Space` keys (when not editing) call `moveSelection(1)` / `moveSelection(-1)`.
    - **Step 3.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/word_selection_navigation.test.js`). Prioritize testing `selectWord()` and `moveSelection()` logic directly first, then keyboard interactions via `globalKeyHandler`.
    - **Step 3.B (Execute Tests):** Run new tests.
    - **Step 3.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** Refine/fix `app.js` until Module 3 tests pass.
    - **Step 3.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** Briefly check navigation in browser; re-run Module 1 & 2 tests.
    - **Step 3.E (Documentation & Commit):** Update `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` and commit changes.
3.  Continue iteratively through the modules defined in `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`.
