## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL SESSSIONS:

When providing code modifications, adhere to the following presentation guidelines:

1.  **For minor changes confined to a single function or a small, clearly defined block of code (e.g., changing, adding, or removing a few lines):** You must provide the **entire modified function** or block, clearly indicating the start and end of this block. Do not provide only the changed lines or diff-like patches.
2.  **For changes that affect multiple functions, or involve refactoring across different parts of the script:** You must provide the **complete, updated script** in its entirety.

In both cases, you should still provide your reasoning and identify the locations of changes as part of your explanation before presenting the code.

## Session 1 Context: LabelFast Project (LGID-HR Frontend Hardening)

**Date:** (Today's Date - e.g., 2025-05-11)

**Input:**

- `v003.html`: Single-file HTML, CSS, JS proof-of-concept for "LabelFast" text annotation tool.
- `README.md`: Document describing LabelFast v003, its philosophy, features, and PoC status.
- `LGID_FE.md`: Paper detailing the **LGID-HR (LLM-Guided Hardening & Refinement)** methodology for test-verifying LLM-generated frontend PoCs.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Methodology Review:** Reviewed and confirmed understanding of the LGID-HR framework.
2.  **Candidate PoC Selection (Pre-Phase 0-HR):**
    - Selected `v003.html` as the candidate PoC for hardening based on its functional richness and alignment with project goals.
3.  **Phase 0-HR: PoC Analysis, Test Planning & Environment Setup:**
    - **`PoC_Interaction_Spec.md` Creation:** Collaboratively drafted and finalized the `PoC_Interaction_Spec.md` document, detailing key UI components, JavaScript functions/modules, and observed user interactions within `v003.html`.
    - **JavaScript Testing Framework Setup:**
      - Recommended Jest with Testing Library.
      - Created `package.json` and installed necessary dev dependencies (`jest`, `@testing-library/dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `jest-environment-jsdom`).
      - Created `jest.config.js` with `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'`.
      - Created `__tests__` directory.
    - **Refactoring for Testability:**
      - Extracted JavaScript from `v003.html` into a separate `app.js` file, linked via `<script src="./app.js" defer></script>`.
      - Added `data-testid` attributes to key HTML elements in `v003.html` for more reliable test querying.
    - **`PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` Creation:** Collaboratively drafted and finalized the `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`, outlining modules/interactions for hardening and key test scenarios for each.
4.  **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading) - In Progress:**
    - **Step 1.A (Generate Tests):** Generated `__tests__/initial_load.test.js` with initial test cases for Module 1.
    - **Test Environment Debugging:**
      - Resolved "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" by changing `import` to `require` in the test file.
      - Addressed `TypeError: selectedSpan.scrollIntoView is not a function` by mocking `HTMLElement.prototype.scrollIntoView` in the test file.
      - Addressed "SyntaxError: Identifier 'X' has already been declared" by:
        - Refactoring `app.js` to wrap its content in an `initializeApp()` function.
        - Exposing necessary variables and functions from `initializeApp` to the `window` object for test access.
        - Updating `initial_load.test.js` to call `window.initializeApp()` in `beforeEach` and to clean up globals in `afterEach`.
        - Ensuring `app.js` calls `initializeApp()` on `DOMContentLoaded` or when script is loaded deferentially for browser execution.
      - Resolved `TypeError: expect(...).toHaveTextContent is not a function` (and similar for other matchers) by:
        - Installing `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
        - Creating `jest.setup.js` to `require('@testing-library/jest-dom')`.
        - Updating `jest.config.js` to use `setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js']`.
    - **Step 1.B & 1.C (Execute & Refine/Fix):** Iteratively ran tests, identified a failing assertion in the "Completed!" message test related to the help button's visibility, and corrected the test assertion to match the code's behavior (checking for `.hidden` class instead of DOM removal).
    - **Module 1 Completion:** All 7 tests for Module 1 in `initial_load.test.js` are now passing.

**Current LGID-HR Stage:**

- **Phase 0-HR: COMPLETE.**
- **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.**
  - `app.js` has been significantly refactored for testability.
  - Test environment is stable.
  - Relevant documentation (`PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) updated.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 2):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    - Ensure all changes from Session 1 (updated `v003.html`, `app.js`, `initial_load.test.js`, Jest config files, `package.json`, documentation) are committed.
2.  **Begin Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 2's scope and test objectives.
    - **Step 2.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate (with LLM assistance if desired) a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`) for the `normalizeWords()` and `renderCorrectionArea()` functions.
    - **Step 2.B (Execute Tests):** Run the new tests against the current `app.js`.
    - **Step 2.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** If tests fail, analyze failures and refine/fix `app.js` until all Module 2 tests pass.
    - **Step 2.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** Briefly check rendering in browser; re-run Module 1 tests.
    - **Step 2.E (Documentation & Commit):** Update `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` and commit changes.
3.  Continue iteratively through the modules defined in `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`.

---

**Session 2 Activities & Outcomes (Current Session):**

1.  **Reviewed Plan:** Confirmed focus on Module 2 from `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`.
2.  **Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area):**
    - **Step 2.A (Generate Tests):**
      - Created `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`.
      - Drafted comprehensive tests for `normalizeWords()` function (10 tests).
      - Drafted tests for `renderCorrectionArea()` function, covering:
        - Availability on `window`.
        - Display of "Sentence is empty..." message (1 test).
        - Correct creation of `<span>` elements for words (1 test).
        - Correct `textContent` and `data-index` for word spans (1 test).
        - Correct application of selection classes (1 test).
        - Verification that word span click listeners update selection correctly (using direct DOM `.click()`) (1 test).
        - Verification that word span dblclick listeners trigger `initiateWordEdit` effects (using direct DOM `dispatchEvent`) (1 test).
    - **Step 2.B (Execute Tests) & 2.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):**
      - All 10 tests for `normalizeWords()` passed without changes to `app.js`.
      - Iteratively developed and ran tests for `renderCorrectionArea()`.

  - `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js` created and all tests passing.
  - Relevant documentation (`PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) should be updated to reflect Module 2 completion.

---

**Plan for Next Session (Session 3):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    - Ensure all changes from Session 2 (updated `app.js`, new `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`, updated documentation like `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) are committed.
2.  **Begin Phase 3-HR (Module 3: Word Selection & Navigation):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 3's scope:
      - **Target JS:** `selectWord()`, `moveSelection()`, click/dblclick listeners on word spans (from `renderCorrectionArea` - *note: basic listener attachment was covered in Module 2, Module 3 will focus more on the *behavior* of `selectWord` and `moveSelection` themselves, and effects of keyboard navigation via `globalKeyHandler`*), relevant parts of `globalKeyHandler()` (`ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `Space`, `Shift+Space`).
      - **Key Test Scenarios/Objectives:**
        - `selectWord()`:
          - Correctly updates `window.selectedWordIndex` for valid, out-of-bounds, and edge-case indices.
          - Calls `renderCorrectionArea()` (verified by checking UI updates/class changes).
          - Correctly handles `isEditingWord` guard.
          - (Optional: `scrollIntoView` mock call verification if deemed critical, though it's often a side effect of less importance for core logic).
        - `moveSelection()`:
          - Correctly calculates and calls `selectWord()` for next/previous, including wrapping.
          - No action if only one word or no words.
          - Correctly handles `isEditingWord` guard.
        - `globalKeyHandler` for selection:
          - `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` keys call `moveSelection(-1)` / `moveSelection(1)`.
          - `Space`/`Shift+Space` keys (when not editing) call `moveSelection(1)` / `moveSelection(-1)`.
    - **Step 3.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/word_selection_navigation.test.js`). Prioritize testing `selectWord()` and `moveSelection()` logic directly first, then keyboard interactions via `globalKeyHandler`.
    - **Step 3.B (Execute Tests):** Run new tests.
    - **Step 3.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** Refine/fix `app.js` until Module 3 tests pass.
    - **Step 3.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** Briefly check navigation in browser; re-run Module 1 & 2 tests.
    - **Step 3.E (Documentation & Commit):** Update `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` and commit changes.
3.  Continue iteratively through the modules defined in `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`.

**Session 2 Summary (Recap):** (As above)

---

**Session 3 Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Reviewed Plan:** Confirmed focus on Module 3.
2.  **Phase 3-HR (Module 3: Word Selection & Navigation):**
    - **Step 3.A (Generate Tests):** Created `__tests__/word_selection_navigation.test.js` (21 tests).
    - **Step 3.B & 3.C (Execute & Refine/Fix):**
      - Identified and fixed `globalKeyHandler` multiple invocation issue for Space/Arrow keys in JSDOM tests by adding `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`.
      - Optionally refactored `selectWord()` for clarity.
      - All 21 tests for Module 3 passed.
    - **Module 3 Completion:** Module 3 marked as COMPLETE & VERIFIED. `app.js` updated. `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` updated.
3.  **Phase 4-HR (Module 4: Word Editing Flow (ContentEditable)):**
    - **Step 4.A (Generate Tests):** Created `__tests__/word_editing_flow.test.js` (14 tests).
    - **Step 4.B & 4.C (Execute & Refine/Fix):**
      - Addressed test failures related to JSDOM focus limitations by spying on `HTMLElement.prototype.focus` calls.
      - Corrected test setup for "no word selected" scenario.
      - Switched to using `fireEvent.keyDown/blur` directly on the `contenteditable` span for testing its internal listeners, improving reliability over `userEvent.keyboard` for this specific case.
      - Utilized Jest's fake timers for testing `blur` handler's `setTimeout`.
      - All 14 tests for Module 4 passed after iterations.
    - **Step 4.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** All regression tests passed.
    - **Step 4.E (Documentation):** Cleaned diagnostic logs from `app.js`. `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` updated to mark Module 4 as "Verified & Hardened".
    - **Module 4 Completion:** Module 4 marked as COMPLETE & VERIFIED. `app.js` is stable for this module.

**Current LGID-HR Stage (End of Session 3):**

- **Phase 0-HR: COMPLETE.**

---

**Plan for Next Session (Session 4):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    - Ensure all changes from Session 3 (updated `app.js`, new `__tests__/word_editing_flow.test.js`, updated `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) are committed.
2.  **Begin Phase 5-HR (Module 5: Word Deletion):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 5's scope:
      - **Target JS:** `deleteSelectedWord()`, relevant part of `globalKeyHandler()` (`Delete`, `Backspace`).
      - **Key Test Scenarios/Objectives:**
        - Pressing `Delete` or `Backspace` on a selected word (not editing) calls `deleteSelectedWord()`.
        - Word at `selectedWordIndex` is removed from `correctedWords`.
        - If words remain, selection moves to the new word at `selectedWordIndex` (or previous if last was deleted).
        - If last word is deleted, `selectedWordIndex` becomes -1 (or `correctionArea` shows empty message).
        - `#correctionArea` re-renders.
        - Cannot delete if no word selected or if `isEditingWord` is true.
    - **Step 5.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js`).
    - **Step 5.B (Execute Tests):** Run new tests.
    - **Step 5.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** Refine/fix `app.js` until Module 5 tests pass. Pay attention to selection logic after deletion.

- `v003.html`, `app.js` (updated from Session 3), `README.md`, `LGID_FE.md`, `PoC_Interaction_Spec.md`.
- `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` (updated for Modules 1-4).
- Jest testing environment, `__tests__/initial_load.test.js`, `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`, `__tests__/word_selection_navigation.test.js`, `__tests__/word_editing_flow.test.js`.

**Session 3 Summary (Recap):**

1.  **Module 3 (Word Selection & Navigation):** Completed and verified. `app.js` updated (e.g., `stopImmediatePropagation` for space/arrow keys). `__tests__/word_selection_navigation.test.js` (21 tests) created and passing.
2.  **Module 4 (Word Editing Flow):** Completed and verified. `app.js` stable for this module. `__tests__/word_editing_flow.test.js` (14 tests) created and passing. `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` updated for Modules 3 & 4.
3.  Total tests at end of Session 3: 59.

---

**Session 4 Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Reviewed Plan:** Confirmed focus on Module 5.
2.  **Phase 5-HR (Module 5: Word Deletion):**
    - **Target JS:** `deleteSelectedWord()`, relevant part of `globalKeyHandler()` (`Delete`, `Backspace`).
    - **Step 5.A (Generate Tests):** Created `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js`. Drafted 11 comprehensive tests covering:
      - Deletion via 'Delete' and 'Backspace' keys.
      - Correct removal of words from `correctedWords`.
      - Appropriate selection updates (first, middle, last, only word).
      - Handling of empty state after deleting the only word.
      - UI re-rendering (verified by checking `getCorrectionAreaWords()` and `getSelectedWordSpan()`).
      - Guard conditions (no deletion if no word selected or if `isEditingWord` is true).
      - Verification of `e.preventDefault()` and `correctionAreaEl.focus()` calls.
    - **Step 5.B (Execute Tests) & 5.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):**
      - Initial tests revealed an issue where `correctedWords` became empty unexpectedly for multi-word deletions, and `correctionAreaEl.focus()` calls were not always matching expectations.
      - **Refinement 1 (app.js):** Modified `deleteSelectedWord()` to remove a redundant `renderCorrectionArea()` call (as `selectWord()` already calls it).
      - **Refinement 2 (app.js):** Added `e.stopImmediatePropagation()` to the 'Delete' and 'Backspace' cases in `globalKeyHandler` to prevent potential multiple invocations. This was key to fixing the array emptying issue.
      - **Refinement 3 (test.js):** Corrected the focus assertion in `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js` to use `mockFocus.mock.instances.toContain(window.correctionAreaEl)` for prototype spies.
      - **Refinement 4 (test.js):** Adjusted focus assertion logic for guard condition tests to check that _no additional_ focus call was made by `deleteSelectedWord`, rather than asserting no focus call at all on `correctionAreaEl`.
      - **Syntax Error Fix (test.js):** Corrected a nesting issue in `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js` where two tests were outside their parent `describe` block.
      - After these iterations, all 11 tests for Module 5 passed.
    - **Step 5.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):**
      - All previous modules' tests (59 tests) re-ran and passed.
      - User confirmed manual spot-check of word deletion in the browser is working as expected.
    - **Step 5.E (Documentation & Commit):**
      - `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` updated to mark Module 5 as "Verified & Hardened".
      - User confirmed all changes (updated `app.js`, new `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js`, updated `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) are committed.
    - **Module 5 Completion:** Module 5 is "COMPLETE & VERIFIED".

**Current LGID-HR Stage (End of Session 4):**

- **Phase 0-HR: COMPLETE.**
- **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (7 tests)
- **Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (17 tests)
- **Phase 3-HR (Module 3: Word Selection & Navigation): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (21 tests)
- **Phase 4-HR (Module 4: Word Editing Flow (ContentEditable)): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (14 tests)
- **Phase 5-HR (Module 5: Word Deletion): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (11 tests)
  - Total tests passed: 7 + 17 + 21 + 14 + 11 = **70 tests**.
  - `app.js` updated with fixes in `deleteSelectedWord` and `globalKeyHandler`.

2.  **Begin Phase 6-HR (Module 6: Sentence Reset Functionality):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 6's scope:
      - **Target JS:** `handleReset()`, `resetBtn` click listener, relevant part of `globalKeyHandler()` (`Esc`).
      - **Key Test Scenarios/Objectives:**
        - Clicking `#resetBtn` calls `handleReset()`.
        - Pressing `Esc` (when not editing and help modal closed) calls `handleReset()`.
        - `correctedWords` is reverted to `originalTargetForReset`.
        - `selectedWordIndex` is reset (typically to first word or -1 if empty after reset).
        - `#correctionArea` re-renders with original words.
        - `isEditingWord` is false (should be ensured, though reset typically happens when not editing).
        - `correctionAreaEl.focus()` or appropriate element focus after reset.
    - **Step 6.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/sentence_reset.test.js`).
    - **Step 6.B (Execute Tests):** Run new tests.
    - **Step 6.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** Refine/fix `app.js` until Module 6 tests pass.
    - **Step 6.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** Briefly check reset functionality in browser; re-run all previous modules' tests (70 tests).
    - **Step 6.E (Documentation & Commit):** Update `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` and commit changes.
3.  Continue iteratively through the modules defined in `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` (Modules 7, 8, 9 remain).

## Session 5 Context

**Date:** (Today's Date - e.g., 2025-05-23)

**Input from Previous Sessions:**

- `v003.html`, `app.js` (updated from Session 4), `README.md`, `LGID_FE.md`, `PoC_Interaction_Spec.md`.
- `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` (updated for Modules 1-5).
- Jest testing environment, `__tests__/initial_load.test.js`, `__tests__/correction_area_rendering.test.js`, `__tests__/word_selection_navigation.test.js`, `__tests__/word_editing_flow.test.js`, `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js`.

**Session 4 Summary (Recap):**

1.  **Module 5 (Word Deletion):** Completed and verified. `app.js` updated with fixes in `deleteSelectedWord` and `globalKeyHandler` (added `stopImmediatePropagation`). `__tests__/word_deletion.test.js` (11 tests) created and passing. `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` updated.
2.  Total tests at end of Session 4: 70.

---

**Session 5 Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Reviewed Plan:** Confirmed focus on Module 6.
2.  **Phase 6-HR (Module 6: Sentence Reset Functionality):**
    - **Target JS:** `handleReset()`, `resetBtn` click listener, relevant part of `globalKeyHandler()` (`Esc`).
    - **Step 6.A (Generate Tests):** Created `__tests__/sentence_reset.test.js`. Drafted 10 comprehensive tests covering:
      - Reset via Reset button and Escape key.
      - Correct reversion of `correctedWords` to `originalTargetForReset`.
      - Appropriate selection updates (to first word or -1 if empty).
      - UI re-rendering and empty message display.
      - `isEditingWord` state after reset.
      - Guard conditions (`isEditingWord`, `allCompleted`, help modal open).
      - Verification of `e.preventDefault()` and `correctionAreaEl.focus()` calls.
      - Handling of reset when `originalTargetForReset` is empty.
    - **Step 6.B (Execute Tests) & 6.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):**
      - Initial tests (4 failures) revealed issues with focus assertions and the `isEditingWord` state when `Esc` is pressed during an active edit.
      - **Refinement 1 (app.js):** Modified `handleReset()` to ensure `window.correctionAreaEl.focus()` is called consistently after reset logic, regardless of whether the sentence becomes empty or not.
      - **Refinement 2 (test.js):** In `__tests__/sentence_reset.test.js`, for the test `Escape key does not trigger reset if isEditingWord is true...`, changed the event dispatch target from `document` to the `activeEditable` element itself. This ensured the specific `keydown` listener on the contenteditable span (which calls `cancelWordEdit` and `stopPropagation`) was correctly triggered, leading to `isEditingWord` becoming `false` as expected by `cancelWordEdit`.
      - After these iterations, all 10 tests for Module 6 passed.
    - **Step 6.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):**
      - All previous modules' tests (70 tests) re-ran and passed alongside Module 6 tests. Total 80 tests passing.
      - User confirmed manual spot-check of sentence reset functionality (button and Esc key) in the browser is working as expected.
    - **Step 6.E (Documentation & Commit):**
      - `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` updated to mark Module 6 as "Verified & Hardened".
      - User confirmed all changes (updated `app.js`, new `__tests__/sentence_reset.test.js`, updated `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md`) are committed.
    - **Module 6 Completion:** Module 6 is "COMPLETE & VERIFIED".

**Current LGID-HR Stage (End of Session 5):**

- **Phase 0-HR: COMPLETE.**
- **Phase 1-HR (Module 1: Initial State & Sentence Loading): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (7 tests)
- **Phase 2-HR (Module 2: Word Tokenization & Rendering in Correction Area): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (17 tests)
- **Phase 3-HR (Module 3: Word Selection & Navigation): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (21 tests)
- **Phase 4-HR (Module 4: Word Editing Flow (ContentEditable)): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (14 tests)
- **Phase 5-HR (Module 5: Word Deletion): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (11 tests)
- **Phase 6-HR (Module 6: Sentence Reset Functionality): COMPLETE & VERIFIED.** (10 tests)
  - Total tests passed: 7 + 17 + 21 + 14 + 11 + 10 = **80 tests**.
  - `app.js` updated with refinements in `handleReset()`.

**Plan for Next Session (Session 6):**

1.  **(Git Workflow):**
    - (Already done by user for Session 5 changes).
2.  **Begin Phase 7-HR (Module 7: Sentence Submission & Progression):**
    - Refer to `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` for Module 7's scope:
      - **Target JS:** `handleSubmit()`, `submitBtn` click listener, relevant part of `globalKeyHandler()` (`Ctrl+Enter`), interaction with `loadSentence()`.
      - **Key Test Scenarios/Objectives:**
        - Clicking `#submitBtn` or pressing `Ctrl+Enter` calls `handleSubmit()`.
        - `console.log` is called with correct data (mock/spy on `console.log`).
        - `currentSentenceIndex` is incremented.
        - `loadSentence()` is called with the new index.
        - Verify UI updates to reflect the next sentence (source, target, correction area, status text).
        - Verify UI updates to "Completed!" state after the last sentence.
        - Cannot submit if `isEditingWord` is true or `allCompleted` is true (guard conditions).
    - **Step 7.A (Generate Tests):** Collaboratively generate a new test file (e.g., `__tests__/sentence_submission.test.js`).
    - **Step 7.B (Execute Tests):** Run new tests.
    - **Step 7.C (Refine/Fix PoC JavaScript):** Refine/fix `app.js` until Module 7 tests pass.
    - **Step 7.D (Manual Spot-Check & Regression):** Briefly check submission in browser; re-run all previous modules' tests (80 tests).
    - **Step 7.E (Documentation & Commit):** Update `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` and commit changes.
3.  Continue iteratively through the modules defined in `PoC_Hardening_Guide.md` (Modules 8, 9 remain after Module 7).
